Paste the 2 (or more) most recent clipboard entries separated by a new line, space, or comma.

Paste up to 6 entries at once, by appending a number to the keyword e.g. `stitch5`

By default, clipboard entries are separated by new lines. To separate clipboard entries with **spaces**, use the *shift* (⇧) modifier.  For **commas**, use the *option* (⌥) modifier.

That's about all there is to it.  Clip, clip away!
